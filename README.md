## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and cleans dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardizes features for optimal model performance.
- **KNN Model Training**: Implements KNN to classify data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots for better insight into classification results.

## Project Files

### 1. `KNN_Project_Data`
This dataset contains numerical and categorical variables, used as features for classification.
- **Feature Columns**: Various numerical attributes representing observations.
- **Target Column**: Class label indicating category membership.

### 2. `KNearestNeighbors_Project.py`
This script preprocesses data, applies KNN classification, and visualizes results.

#### Key Components:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**:
  - Reads dataset and checks for missing values.
  - Converts categorical variables if necessary.

- **Feature Scaling**:
  - Applies **StandardScaler** for uniform feature distribution.

- **Model Training & Prediction**:
  - Splits dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trains a **K-Nearest Neighbors classifier**.
  - Predicts target labels for test data.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Computes accuracy score.
  - Generates a confusion matrix and classification report.

- **Visualization**:
  - Plots decision boundaries.
  - Displays confusion matrix heatmap.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('KNN_Project_Data')

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data.drop('Target', axis=1))

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data_scaled, data['Target'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train KNN model
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
```
